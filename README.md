## Learning to use gcov 

The file ``assignment.c`` contain two functions:

1. ``hasSameSign`` - which checks if the two numbers have the same sign or not.

2. ``stateOfH2O`` - given the temperature of H2O, this function prints the state of H2O at that temperature.

The file ``assignment.c.gcov`` contains the coverage statistics of the program.
